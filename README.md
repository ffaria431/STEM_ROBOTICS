Step 1: Run datacollection.py (Webcam is used to read the gesture in real-time)
Step 2: Run dataset.py (9 Hand Gesture are used as dataset)
Step 3: Run traingest.py (A neural netwok is trained and validated using 9 different hand gesture)
Step 4: Run predict.py (9 different Hand Gesture is predicted in real time)





Images of 9 different Hand Gestures are used to train a neural network.
TrainDataSet and TestDataSet are available in attached zip file in jpg format.
The model can read data in real-time from webcam to predict the Hand Gesture from 9 different classes.
